####  Nested NER 

We take ACE2005 as an example for *NESTED NER* to illustrate the process of data prepration.  

Source files for SEBI-MRC-NER contains a list of json in the format : 


```

```json 
{
"context": "begala dr . palmisano , again , thanks for staying with us through the break .",
"end_position": [
    2,
    4,
    12
    ],
"entity_label": "PER",
"impossible": false,
"qas_id": "4.3",
"query": "3",
"span_position": [
    "1;2",
    "1;4",
    "11;12"],
"start_position": [
    1,
    1,
    11]
}
```
